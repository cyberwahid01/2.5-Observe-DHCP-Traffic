<h2>Installation, Setup, Resource Setup, Executing Functions</h2>

1. I started off initialising packet capture within Wireshark and filtered for DHCP traffic. As we can see nothing is showing as I have not

2. In this example, I had to run a dhcp.bat file which contained the release and renew commands for this protocol. Please read below for a breakdown of what is happening during this process.

3. This sequence represents a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) process, showing a device obtaining an IP address. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown:

1297 - DHCP Release:
IP 10.0.0.4 informs the DHCP server (168.63.129.16) that it is releasing its IP address, making it available for others.

1315 - DHCP Discover:
A new device (0.0.0.0) broadcasts to 255.255.255.255 to find a DHCP server, initiating the process to request an IP.

1316 - DHCP Offer:
The DHCP server (168.63.129.16) responds with an IP offer and other configuration details, referencing the same transaction ID (0xeb864ec4).

1317 - DHCP Request:
The device requests the offered IP, confirming its acceptance of the configuration.

1318 - DHCP ACK:
The DHCP server acknowledges the request and assigns the IP address to the device, completing the DHCP process.

This sequence shows the typical four-step DORA process: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge, with an additional Release step at the start.
